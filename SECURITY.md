## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Contact

For security vulnerabilities, please contact our security team:

- **Primary Contact**: security@gitguard.dev
- **GitHub Security**: [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Ava-Prime/gitguard/security/advisories)
- **Issues**: For non-sensitive security issues, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Ava-Prime/gitguard/issues) with the 'security' label

### Disclosure Process

1. **Initial Report**: Send a detailed report to security@gitguard.dev
   - Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Provide proof-of-concept if available
   - Specify affected versions and components
   - Use PGP encryption for sensitive details

2. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**

3. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide initial assessment within **1 week**
   - Confirm vulnerability validity
   - Assign severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Provide estimated timeline for resolution

4. **Investigation & Fix**: Development of security patch (best effort)
   - Critical: 2 weeks
   - High: 1 month
   - Medium: 2 months
   - Low: Next major release

5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fix is available
   - Security advisory published
   - CVE assigned if applicable
   - Credit given to reporter (unless anonymity requested)

### Response Targets (Best Effort)

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 48 hours      | 2 weeks          |
| High     | 1 week        | 1 month          |
| Medium   | 2 weeks       | 2 months         |
| Low      | 1 month       | Next release     |

**Note**: As an early-stage project, these are target timelines and not guaranteed SLAs.

**Critical Vulnerabilities** include:
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration
- Supply chain attacks

**High Vulnerabilities** include:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Insecure direct object references
- Security misconfigurations

### Security Features

GitGuard implements multiple security layers:

- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of exposed credentials
- **Policy Enforcement**: OPA-based security policies
- **Container Security**: Image scanning and signing with Cosign
- **Supply Chain Security**: SBOM generation and attestation
- **Access Controls**: RBAC with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest

### Security Best Practices

When deploying GitGuard:

1. **Environment Security**:
   - Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
   - Enable audit logging for all security events
   - Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
   - Implement network segmentation

2. **Configuration Security**:
   - Review and customize OPA policies for your environment
   - Enable all security scanning features
   - Configure proper backup and disaster recovery
   - Use secrets management systems (not environment variables)

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Monitor security events and policy violations
   - Set up alerts for critical security events
   - Regularly review access logs and user activities
   - Implement incident response procedures

### Security Updates

Security updates are distributed through:

- **GitHub Releases**: Tagged releases with security patches
- **Container Images**: Updated images in container registry
- **Security Advisories**: Detailed vulnerability information
- **Mailing List**: security-announce@gitguard.dev (low-volume)
