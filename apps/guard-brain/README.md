# GitGuard Org-Brain

The **guard-brain** service provides intelligent organizational analysis, policy transparency, and relationship mapping capabilities for GitGuard's security governance platform.

## Scope

This service handles:

- **Policy Transparency**: Automated source attribution and policy traceability
- **Mermaid Graph Generation**: Visual relationship mapping and organizational structure
- **Owners Index Management**: Dynamic ownership tracking and responsibility mapping
- **Graph API**: RESTful API for organizational relationship queries
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience testing and failure simulation
- **SLO Monitoring**: Service level objective tracking and alerting

## Architecture

### Worker Interfaces

The guard-brain service implements worker interfaces for distributed processing:

#### Policy Transparency Workers
- `PolicySourceWorker`: Tracks policy origins and source references
- `TransparencyIndexWorker`: Maintains policy transparency metrics
- `SourceAttributionWorker`: Links policies to their authoritative sources

#### Graph Generation Workers
- `MermaidGraphWorker`: Generates Mermaid diagrams for organizational relationships
- `OwnershipGraphWorker`: Creates ownership and responsibility visualizations
- `RelationshipMapWorker`: Maps complex organizational dependencies

#### Graph API Workers
- `GraphQueryWorker`: Handles Graph API endpoint requests
- `RelationshipWorker`: Processes organizational relationship queries
- `OwnerIndexWorker`: Manages dynamic owners index updates

### Temporal Integration

If using Temporal for workflow orchestration:

- Workers register with Temporal task queues
- Workflows coordinate multi-step analysis processes
- Activities handle individual analysis tasks
- Retry policies ensure reliable processing

### Graph API Endpoints

The service exposes FastAPI endpoints for organizational queries:

- `/graph/health` - Service health check
- `/graph/owners` - Owners index and responsibility mapping
- `/graph/policies` - Policy transparency and source attribution
- `/graph/relationships` - Organizational relationship queries
- `/graph/mermaid` - Mermaid graph generation
- `/graph/chaos/drills` - Chaos engineering drill results
- `/graph/slo/metrics` - SLO monitoring and metrics

## Configuration

- `POLICY_TRANSPARENCY_ENABLED`: Enable policy source attribution
- `MERMAID_GRAPHS_ENABLED`: Enable Mermaid graph generation
- `GRAPH_API_ENABLED`: Enable Graph API endpoints
- `CHAOS_ENGINEERING_ENABLED`: Enable chaos engineering features
- `SLO_MONITORING_ENABLED`: Enable SLO monitoring and alerting
- `OWNERS_INDEX_PATH`: Path to owners index configuration
- `POLICY_SOURCES_PATH`: Path to policy source definitions
- `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`: Temporal namespace (if using Temporal)
