# Getting Started with GitGuard

Welcome to GitGuard! This guide will help you get up and running with intelligent PR governance in minutes.

## What is GitGuard?

GitGuard is an autonomous repository steward that:

- **ü§ñ Automates PR decisions** - Merges safe changes, blocks risky ones
- **üìã Enforces governance policies** - Release windows, security reviews, dependency management
- **üìö Generates living documentation** - Real-time PR digests with policy transparency
- **üï∏Ô∏è Maps relationships** - Visual Mermaid graphs showing code and governance connections
- **üë• Tracks ownership** - Dynamic owners index based on recent activity
- **üìä Provides visibility** - Dashboards with SLO monitoring and chaos engineering validation
- **üîó Enables integration** - Graph API for cross-origin portal access

## Quick Demo (2 minutes)

```bash
# One-command setup
make setup && make up && make demo-quick
```

This will:
1. Start all GitGuard services locally
2. Run a 2-minute demo showing low-risk and security scenarios
3. Open documentation portal and dashboards

### Access Points

- **üìö Documentation Portal**: http://localhost:8001

## Understanding GitGuard Workflow

### The Three-Step Process

Every PR goes through GitGuard's three-step evaluation:

#### 1. üéØ Risk Assessment

GitGuard analyzes multiple factors to compute a risk score:

- **Code Complexity**: Lines changed, cyclomatic complexity
- **Test Coverage**: Coverage delta, test quality
- **Security Impact**: Dependency changes, sensitive file modifications
- **Historical Patterns**: Past failure rates, revert frequency

#### 2. üö™ Policy Gate

OPA (Open Policy Agent) enforces governance rules:

- **Release Windows**: Block deployments during high-risk periods
- **Infrastructure Reviews**: Require owner approval for infra changes
- **Dependency Security**: Ensure SBOM scans pass for dependency updates
- **Risk Thresholds**: Auto-merge low-risk, require review for high-risk

#### 3. üìñ Org-Brain Intelligence

Codex ("org-brain") generates comprehensive organizational intelligence:

- **PR Digests**: What changed, why it matters, impact assessment
- **Policy Transparency**: Decision explanations with source code references
- **Mermaid Graphs**: Visual relationship maps showing connections
- **Owners Index**: Dynamic ownership tracking based on recent activity
- **Knowledge Graph**: PostgreSQL-backed relationship mapping
- **Graph API**: Real-time access to relationship data

## Demo Scenarios

GitGuard includes three demo flows to showcase different use cases:

### `make demo-quick` (2 minutes)
**Target Audience**: Developers
**Scenarios**: Low-risk auto-merge + Security policy enforcement

### `make demo-investor` (5 minutes)

### Integration Examples

**Portal Integration (JavaScript)**:
```javascript
// Fetch ownership for current file
const ownership = await fetch(`http://localhost:8002/api/v1/ownership/files?path=${filePath}`);
const data = await ownership.json();
console.log(`File owner: ${data.primary}`);
```

**CLI Integration (Python)**:
```python
import requests

# Get expertise areas for a user
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8002/api/v1/ownership/users/alice@company.com")
user_data = response.json()
print(f"Expertise: {', '.join(user_data['expertise_areas'])}")
```

**Dashboard Widget (curl + jq)**:
```bash
# Generate ownership summary for dashboard
curl -s http://localhost:8002/api/v1/ownership/summary | \
  jq -r '.top_contributors[] | "\(.email): \(.contribution_percentage)%"'
```

### API Documentation

Full API documentation is available at:
- **Interactive Docs**: http://localhost:8002/docs
- **OpenAPI Spec**: http://localhost:8002/openapi.json
- **Graph Schema**: http://localhost:8002/api/v1/schema

## Customizing GitGuard

### Adding Custom Policies

1. **Define Policy Logic** in `policies/guard_rules.rego`:
```rego
# Example: Block PRs that modify critical files without senior review
critical_files_need_senior_review {
    input.files[_].path == "src/payment/processor.py"
    not input.approvals[_].user.role == "senior"
}
```

2. **Create Documentation** in `docs_src/policies/`:
```markdown
# Critical Files Policy

Changes to payment processing code require senior developer review.

## Rationale
Payment code has direct financial impact...
```

3. **Test the Policy**:
```bash
pytest tests/policies/test_critical_files.py
```

### Configuring Risk Scoring

Edit `config/gitguard.settings.yaml`:

```yaml
risk:
  weights:
    complexity: 0.3      # Code complexity factor
    coverage: 0.2        # Test coverage impact
    security: 0.4        # Security scan results
    history: 0.1         # Historical patterns
  thresholds:
    auto_merge: 30       # Auto-merge below this score
    require_review: 70   # Require review above this score
```
