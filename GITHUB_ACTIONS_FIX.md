# GitHub Actions Billing & Permissions Fix Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Workflow Permissions Fixed**: Added `packages: write` and `id-token: write` to release.yml workflow
‚ùå **Billing Issue**: GitHub Actions not starting due to billing/spending limit flag
‚ùå **Repository Permissions**: Need to configure workflow permissions in repository settings

## üö® Critical Steps to Fix GitHub Actions

### 1. Fix Billing Issues (URGENT)

**Problem**: GitHub Actions runs aren't starting due to billing/spending-limit flag.

**Solution**:
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Billing & plans** in your GitHub account/organization
2. Update payment method if payment failed
3. Increase spending limit if it's set to $0
4. Verify billing is active and in good standing

**GitHub Error**: This exact error occurs when payments fail or spending limit is 0.

### 2. Configure Repository Workflow Permissions

**Problem**: Release-Please needs permission to create PRs, and workflows need GHCR access.

**Solution**:
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Workflow permissions**
2. Set to **"Read and write permissions"**
3. Enable **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
4. Apply to both repository AND organization settings if applicable

### 3. Verify Workflow Permissions (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

The following permissions have been added to `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write        # For creating releases
  pull-requests: write   # For Release-Please PRs
  packages: write        # For GHCR publishing
  id-token: write        # For keyless signing with Cosign
```

## üß™ Testing After Fixes

### Manual Workflow Trigger
Once billing is fixed, test the release workflow:

```bash
# Trigger release workflow manually
gh workflow run release.yml

# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow release.yml

# View detailed logs
gh run view --log
```

### Verify GHCR Access
After successful run, verify container publishing:

```bash
# Check if container was published
docker pull ghcr.io/ava-prime/gitguard:latest

# Verify container signature
cosign verify ghcr.io/ava-prime/gitguard:latest
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If workflows still don't start:
1. Check organization-level billing settings
2. Verify repository isn't archived or disabled
3. Check if Actions are enabled for the repository
4. Review organization security policies

### If GHCR publishing fails:
1. Verify `packages: write` permission is set
2. Check if GHCR is enabled for the organization
3. Ensure container registry visibility settings allow publishing

### If Release-Please doesn't create PRs:
1. Verify `pull-requests: write` permission
2. Check if "Allow GitHub Actions to create PRs" is enabled
3. Ensure branch protection rules allow automated PRs
